## Speed Scanr

Speed Scanr is an API-driven app that can analyze website performance data and show recommendations on how to improve it. 

Tools like [Page Speed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) already do a similar thing, but I always found that they gave meager information about how to improve on failing audits. To be fair, Google couldn't recommend one solution versus another because they need to remain impartial. Speed Scanr does not do this - I've programmed the app to show my recommendations on how to fix common pagespeed issues like FCP, FID, CLS, and so on. 

## Project Status

Currently, Speed Scanr is still **in development**.
