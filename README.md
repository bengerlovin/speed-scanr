## Speed Scanr

Speed Scanr is an API-driven app that can analyze website performance data and show recommendations on how to improve it. 

Performance is a huge concern when building websites, and the gold-standard of speed monitoring tools is [Google's PageSpeed API]([https://link](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)). Speed Scanr builds on top of the PageSpeed API by ranking perfomance audits in order of priority and by providing tips on how to improve each audit.

## Project Status

Currently, Speed Scanr is still **in development**.
